Scaling Fractals in the Domain of Reals

Scaling Fractals in the Domain of Reals
A study exploring self-similar, scaling fractal behavior in real-number systems derived from the Collatz function.
This repository will ultimately include:
  - The original data analysis code (Python, NumPy, mpmath)
	- Data visualizations and log-log plots
	- Supplemental tables and figures from the paper
	- Notes on methodology and exploratory techniques

The goal of this work is not to prove or resolve the Collatz conjecture, but to observe emergent structure in the form of deterministic fractal scaling. The project focuses on Analogous Ancestry, a method of comparing sibling-node subtree lineage counts across tree levels.
